Two small scripts that were created in line for my TryHackMe.com room titled 'Linux strength training'. The following scripts can allow the user to to generate a 
a specified number of files with a specified number of paragraphs/lines/words/dates.

Script description:
FileGen-RandomNames.py - Can generate many files with random names and a specified amount of lorem ipsum paragrahs.
FileGen-DateChatLogs.sh - Can generate a specified number of dates (start date to end date) to produce many chat logs for a CTF (does not produce lorem ipsum text).
